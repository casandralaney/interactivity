```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)
```

```{r}
set.seed(1)
```

```{r}
list_norms = 
  list(
    a = rnorm(20, 3, 1),
    b = rnorm(20, 0, 5),
    c = rnorm(20, 10, .2),
    d = rnorm(20, -3, 1)
  )

is.list(list_norms)
```

```{r}
mean_and_sd = function(x) {
  
  if (!is.numeric(x)) {
    stop("Argument x should be numeric")
  } else if (length(x) == 1) {
    stop("Cannot be computed for length 1 vectors")
  }
  
  mean_x = mean(x)
  sd_x = sd(x)

  tibble(
    mean = mean_x, 
    sd = sd_x
  )
}
```

```{r}
mean_and_sd(list_norms[[1]])
mean_and_sd(list_norms[[2]])
mean_and_sd(list_norms[[3]])
mean_and_sd(list_norms[[4]])
```

Replicate this process using a for loop

```{r}
output = vector("list", length = 4)

for (i in 1:4) {
  
  output[[i]] = mean_and_sd(list_norms[[i]])
}

output
```


Same thing as for loop, just one line of code
```{r}
output = map(list_norms, mean_and_sd)

output
```


MAP variants
```{r}
map_dfr(list_norms, mean_and_sd, .id = "sample")

map_dbl(list_norms, median)
```

## List Columns

Try to put my list into a df

```{r}

listcol_df =
  tibble(
    name = c("a", "b", "c", "d"),
    sample = list_norms
  )

rnorm
```

did this really work?

```{r}
pull(listcol_df, name)
pull(listcol_df, sample)

```

Can I apply 'mean_and_sd'??

```{r}
mean_and_sd(pull(listcol_df, sample)[[1]])
mean_and_sd(pull(listcol_df, sample)[[2]])
mean_and_sd(pull(listcol_df, sample)[[3]])
mean_and_sd(pull(listcol_df, sample)[[4]])

```


iterate using 'map'

```{r}
map(pull(listcol_df, sample), mean_and_sd)
```

adding a column...

```{r}
listcol_df = 
  listcol_df |>
  mutate(
    summary = map(sample, mean_and_sd)
  )
```



```{r}
listcol_df |>
  select(-sample) |>
  unnest(summary)
```
